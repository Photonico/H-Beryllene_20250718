 * Gets values that BLACS use for internal defaults.
 *
 * This routine gets the values that the BLACS are using for internal defaults. Some values are
 * tied to a BLACS context, and some are more general. The most common use is in retrieving a
 *default system context for input into blacs_gridinit or blacs_gridmap. Some systems, such as MPI*,
 *supply their own version of context. For those users who mix system code with BLACS code, a BLACS
 *context should be formed in reference to a system context. Thus, the grid creation routines take a
 *system context as input. If you wish to have strictly portable code, you may use blacs_get to
 *retrieve a default system context that will include all available processes. This value is not
 *tied to a BLACS context, so the parameter icontxt is unused. blacs_get returns information on
 *three quantities that are tied to an individual BLACS context, which is passed in as icontxt. The
 *information that may be retrieved is:
 *
 * @param icontxt On values of what that are tied to a particular context, this parameter is the
 * integer handle indicating the context. Otherwise, ignored.
 * @param what Indicates what BLACS internal(s) should be returned in val. Present options are:
 * <table>
 * <caption id="multi_row">values of what variable</caption>
 * <tr><th> what = 0   <th> Handle indicating default system context. <th>
 * <tr><th> what = 1   <th> The BLACS message ID range. <th>

 * <tr><th> what = 10  <th>  Handle indicating the system context used to define the BLACS context
 *                           whose handle is icontxt. <th>

 *Coherence for more information about repeatability.<th> <tr><th> what = 16  <th>  Whether

 * Assigns available processes into BLACS process grid.
 *
 * All BLACS codes must call this routine, or its sister routine blacs_gridmap. These routines take
 * the available processes, and assign, or map, them into a BLACS process grid.
 * In other words, they establish how the BLACS coordinate system maps into the native machine
 *process numbering system. Each BLACS grid is contained in a context, so that it does not interfere
 *with distributed operations that occur within other grids/contexts. These grid creation routines
 *may be called repeatedly to define additional contexts/grids. The creation of a grid requires
 *input from all processes that are defined to be in this grid. Processes belonging to more than one
 *grid have to agree on which grid formation will be serviced first, much like the globally blocking
 *sum or broadcast. These grid creation routines set up various internals for the BLACS, and one of
 *them must be called before any calls are made to the non-initialization BLACS. Note that these
 *routines map already existing processes to a grid: the processes are not created dynamically. On
 *most parallel machines, the processes are "created" when you run your executable. When using the
 *PVM BLACS, if the virtual machine has not been set up yet, the routine blacs_setup should be used
 *to create the virtual machine. This routine creates a simple nprow x npcol process grid. This
 *process grid uses the first nprow * npcol processes, and assigns them to the grid in a row- or
 *column-major natural ordering. If these process-to-grid mappings are unacceptable, call
 *blacs_gridmap.
 *
 * @param ictxt handle indicating the system context to be used in creating the BLACS context.
 * Call blacs_get to obtain a default system context. Can be thought of as the communicator created
 *by Cblacs_get
 * @param order Indicates how to map processes to BLACS grid. Options are 'R' for Use row-major
 *natural ordering 'C' for column-major natural ordering
 * @param nprow Indicates how many process rows the process grid should contain.
